# Evolutionary computing
## Introduction

Evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution, and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) consist of several heuristics, which are able to solve optimisation tasks by imitating some aspects of natural evolution. They may use different levels of abstraction, but they are always working on whole populations of possible solutions for a given task. EAs are an approved set of heuristics, which are flexible to use and postulate only neglectible requirements on the
optimisation task.

## Applications

As a practical application, technical trading rules found by the use of EA will be presented.
